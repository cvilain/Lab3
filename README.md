#Lab 3 - Morse Translator

##Brief Overview

The morse translator accepts one 10 character input at a time in the home view and
displays all of these words and phrases as a list under the input field. The user
can then click on any of the phrases and be brought to a new view containing the
morse translation of that phrase as well as two buttons. One of the two buttons
vibrates the string in morse and the other flashes the string in morse using the
camera's flash.

The morse translator does not handle spaces or punctuation, but it can translate all
letters a-z in lowercase or uppercase text.
